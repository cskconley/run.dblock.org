### Stats

| Distance | Time | Pace |
|----------|------|------|
|3.11mi|22m30s|7m14s/mi|

Goal was to run under 21. Remains a goal. This is gun time so I probably did just under 22. Net time seems totally suspicious at 18:16, I donâ€™t think I run sub 6 minute miles.

Discovering how net time vs. gun time in official @usatf races is the new popular vote vs. electoral college.
