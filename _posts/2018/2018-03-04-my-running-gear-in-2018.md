As a beginner runner I have no idea what I am doing as far as running gear is concerned. So I go by trial and error.

### Shoes

I am size 13. I rarely buy shoes retail price because sales often have the best models left unsold given how few people are 6ft6. I am also not too picky and shoe technology is out of control - last year's models are still pretty incredible.

I started running with a pair of [Adidas Supernova Glide Boost](https://runrepeat.com/adidas-supernova-glide-boost) that I bought on sale at [Paragon](https://www.paragonsports.com/) during their warehouse sale. I found them a bit odd during my first run as they seemed strangely elevated, but I love these now as they have proven durable and comfortable.

My second pair is [Nike Fitsole Lite 3](https://runrepeat.com/nike-fs-lite-run). So far I've used them indoors on a treadmill, and they seem to be lighter and thinner than the Adidas.

My actual shoe colors are pictured above.

I use [Under Armour Charged Cotton Mens 2.0 Crew Socks](https://www.modells.com/under-armour-charged-cotton-mens-2.0-crew-socks/U322.html).

### Pants

I bought [Underarmour ColdGearÂ® Armour Compression leggings](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/pid1265649-001-LGT) to run in the cold. These are very comfortable, stretch well, warm and all around amazing. Mine are size LGT, I'm 6ft6 and they work great.

I put a pair of [Champion Mens Jersey Pocket Shorts](https://www.modells.com/champion-mens-jersey-pocket-short/85653.html) over these.

### Top

I use any plain t-shirt and, for now, an [American Apparel California Fleece Hoodie](http://www.americanapparel.com/en/california-fleece-pullover-hoodie_5495w). I get soaking wet in this, so my next purchase is something better.

### Cold

New York gets pretty cold. The essential buy was a [Turtle Fur Neckwarmer](https://www.turtlefur.com/collections/neck-warmers) - the polyester, not the fleece kind. It keeps my neck and my head warm, and I often pull it up to breathe into it. I couldn't have done the freezing 10 degrees [midnight run in Central Park](/2017/12/31/run-4.12mi-0h30m42s.html) without it.

I often use [Odlo base layers](https://odlo.com/row/en-gb/men/apparel/sports-underwear.html) (over a soft t-shirt to avoid rubbing my nipples), a [Helmet Liner Sports Skull Cap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N011DKB) (nice and light) and a pair of [TrailHeads Touchscreen Running Gloves](https://shop.trailheads.com/women/trailheads-elements-touchscreen-running-gloves-black-grey/dp/s010) (don't really keep my fingers warm in the wind or anywhere under 45 degrees).

### Music

I listen to [Di.fm Classic Vocal Trance](https://www.di.fm/classicvocaltrance) with an iPhone tucked into a [Senbor Sports Armband](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071ZRPP25) and a pair of [Plantronics BackBeat FIT Wireless Bluetooth Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071NLCGBK) that I tend to buy refurbished because I keep losing them.

### Pain

I've developed a pretty bad case of ITBS in my left leg. I managed to get rid of it with the [Pro-Tec Athletics IT Band Compression Wrap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G34VV0), [proper stretching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO2ZNz03YEI) and a lot of gym time working my leg strength.
