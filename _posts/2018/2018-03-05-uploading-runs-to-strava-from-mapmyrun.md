I used MapMyRun at first, but switched to Strava. I think both work fine, but most of my friends use Strava, follow each-other, and it looks much more polished. The Strava support FAQ on [Moving your activity history from MapMyRun to Strava](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917757-Moving-your-activity-history-from-MapMyRun-to-Strava) is missing a step of making the run public. Here's what you have to do.

### Export Activities from MapMyRun

Make each workout public, then export a TCX file.

### Import to Strava

Click _Upload Activity_ on the top right of the Strava website. Upload the TCX file and hit _Save and View_.

You can also bulk import multiple runs by uploading a whole bunch of files at once.
