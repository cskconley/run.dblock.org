I spent an unreasonable amount of time researching and buying a running watch. I ended up with a [Fitbit Ionic Adidas Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Ionic-Adidas-Silver-Included/dp/B079P2J6GM).

### Motivation

I used an armband for over a year with my iPhone. The armband got very worn out and it felt like throwing money away to get a new one.

Annoyingly, it left a sweat mark on my arm or long sleeves when running in cold weather. It was also inconvenient to start Strava before a race through the armband's plastic, or having to put the phone away before strapping the armband on. Finally, everyone I knew who ran regularly had a running watch, giving me some serious FOMO.

### Features

I wanted a watch that had GPS, could sync with [Strava](https://www.strava.com), play my favorite music and support payments. I also originally thought I wanted it to receive and send text messages. Finally, the watch needed enough battery life to last a marathon, which I am running in New York in November.

### Samsung Gear S3 Fail

It really sounded like [Samsung Gear S3](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Frontier-Smartwatch-Bluetooth-SM-R760NDAAXAR/dp/B01M7MDK5S) would fit the bill. It had GPS, could sync data [according to Strava](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/218887007-Samsung-Gear-and-Strava), had a [SoundCloud app](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Wearable-Tech/What-happened-to-Soundcloud-Pro-for-Gear-S3/td-p/332106), supported [payments](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00061420/) and had cell service that would [work with messages](https://www.macworld.com/article/3205244/ios/samsung-tizen-smartwatch-iphone-how-to-faq.html) of all kinds. I bought the watch and returned it promptly within 48 hours.

Nothing worked with an iPhone. The iOS app was [crippled to a point of being useless](https://www.imore.com/what-know-about-pairing-samsung-gear-s3-iphone). I couldn't sync to Strava because the Samsung Health app on iOS didn't support external applications. I couldn't install Soundcloud Pro because the Gear S3 app on iOS didn't even list paid apps.

### Fitbit Ionic

I bought the [Fitbit Ionic Adidas Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Ionic-Adidas-Silver-Included/dp/B079P2J6GM). This one was just a Fitbit Ionic, but with a nicer looking color band and some more software for $30 more. Why did I pay extra? Because [I am Russian and I had to stay on brand](https://weirdrussia.com/2015/01/04/why-is-adidas-so-popular-among-russians)!

This watch had GPS, Strava, music and payments, but has no cell service. [This review](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXFWADPCNX3XK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074VDF16R) changed my mind about needing to have a phone on me. In hindsight, I have been really enjoying focusing on my run before, during and especially after. I used to fiddle with my phone to upload the run to Strava or take selfies instead of what I should have really been doing -  stretching.

#### Setup

Setup and the firmware upgrade were pretty slow, but worked. The watch would only see my 2G WiFi and not to anything faster. The iOS app seemed reasonable.

#### Music

I wanted either [di.fm](https://www.di.fm) or long tracks from [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/stream). I learned that to sync music with the Ionic you needed a computer, which was odd but survivable. I [downloaded](https://www.klickaud.com) some SoundCloud tracks onto my laptop and spent a while looking for a way to just copy MP3 files to the watch. The process was actually much more bizarre as the Ionic Mac app only synced iTunes playlists with the watch, so I had to add the MP3s to iTunes, then choose which playlists to sync. That worked well, albeit slowly.

The watch easily connected to my bluetooth headphones and played music well. It cut off occasionally for a split second, but it hasn't been bad, annoying or janky.

#### Running with GPS

I went running with OSR on Tuesday and started a warm-up run from home. The watch froze. I didn't have a phone to lookup how to reboot it, and eventually figured out that you had to press and hold the left and bottom buttons. I tried again after a restart and the GPS showed a laconic _Connecting_ for the entire mile. Was it broken? I was very unhappy, but OSR ran at 8pm sharp and I just had to stop fiddling with it. After about half a mile the watch suddenly acquired a GPS signal and worked for the remainder of the run.

I later learned that GPS had a cold start and needed to download some local satellite data. This took almost 15 minutes in the dense New York city. The watch took under a minute to acquire a GPS signal for my second run.

#### Strava

I installed the Strava app on the watch, connected it on the iPhone, and saw my past runs. It quickly turned out that this app was totally useless and confusing because it didn't sync anything from the watch.

To sync my runs I had to go to [strava.fitbit.com](https://strava.fitbit.com) and authorized Fitbit with Strava through the website. The Fitbit + Strava app then showed up in [my settings](https://www.fitbit.com/settings/applications).

<small>This still didn't work as expected and I [am still trying to get help from Fitbit](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Third-Party-Integrations/Fitbit-Ionic-not-Syncing-to-Strava/td-p/2789043). Since it works for many people I imagine this is going to be fixed.</small>

#### Payments

Payments worked flawlessly with an American Express card at the Walgreens in Union Square to buy me a Gatorade after this morning's 9 mile run. Money clearly solved all many problems.

#### Barcodes

It was nice to find a [barcode app](https://gam.fitbit.com/gallery/app/20ba8b5a-f3f9-4f8c-a5a3-10d9eacbd846) on the Fitbit. I could go to the Equinox without carrying ID.

#### Battery

With the display always on, GPS and playing music the Ionic ate roughly 50% of battery in an hour and a half. I will do a better measurement next time I run with a full charge.

### Apple iWatch

This one had everything. But it was a watch, not a running watch, and I wouldn't buy it out of principle. I wear a Panerai Luminor Marina.

### Garmin Forerunner 645 Music

The [Garmin Forerunner 645 Music](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-contactless-wrist-based-010-01863-20/dp/B078H244WN) seemed to be a slightly more advanced version of the Fitbit Ionic for an extra price. I haven't tried it, but heard great things.
