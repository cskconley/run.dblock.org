I'm running the [#UnitedAirlinesHalf](http://www.nyrr.org/races-and-events/2018/united-airlines-nyc-half) for [@TeamForKids](https://www.runwithtfk.org/Events/Details/101). My fundraising goal of $1,310.00 has been reached and [stands](https://runwithtfk.org/Profile/PublicPage/57858) at $1,640.00 now. Thank you!

You can still donate money to the children on my [fundraising page](https://runwithtfk.org/Profile/PublicPage/57858) or venmo me at [@dblockdotorg](https://venmo.com/dblockdotorg) and I will apply this money to my next fundraise, which should be the 2018 Marathon in New York, my first!

My goal is to beat my [#FLMH](/2018/01/21/run-13.34mi-1h47m18s.html) time at the #UnitedNYCHalf and come under 1h45 on March 18.

Some photos from the fundraising party.
