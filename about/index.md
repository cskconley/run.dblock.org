Hi! This is my running blog. It automatically synchronizes and publishes my runs. Please [follow me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/dblockdotorg).

I always hated running. And now I have a running blog. Read [Why do I run?](/2017/10/01/why-do-i-run.html) or [My Running Gear in 2018](/2018/03/04/my-running-gear-in-2018.html).

Like what you read here? Have questions? <a href='https://github.com/dblock/run.dblock.org/issues/new'>Open an issue</a> for this blog. Feel free to <a href='mailto:dblock@dblock.org'>e-mail me</a>, too.

Finally, if you had enough of running, check out [my art blog](http://art.dblock.org) and [my tech blog](http://code.dblock.org).
